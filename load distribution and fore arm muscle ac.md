load distribution and fore arm muscle activity calc from string to weak grip strength

calculation is done at 25%, 50% ... maximum voluntary force

pressure data is sent to 7 anotomical regions

summed data at all the cylinders and emg data is recorded at 4 crucial muscles

and muscle activity is identified which increases with grip strength

when strength inc -> at thumb load does not change...

at palm inc, finger tips decrease and there is a shift observed in load distribution from fingers to hand

grip sesnsor with a pressure sensor inside to record load at various hand regions 

emg is used to identify the muscle activity while gripping a cylindrical device

these surface electrodes were placed at an interval of 2.5 cm

grip taks with 25%.... mvf elbow at 90 degree

both load distribution and emg data is recor while griiping object

the sensor loads within sensor matrix is displayed as 2d rastor diag

summed force appiled at all regions of the hand 

these forces are calc at 7 regions of our hand and 

assuming 100% force applied on total hand area, the proprtions of each area is observed

results showed that finger tip load decre and palm increase with inc in strength
